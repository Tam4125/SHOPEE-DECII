# Shopee Decii

**Slogan:** Your decision, our duty  

## 1. Introduction
In the highly competitive e-commerce market, Shopee faces significant challenges in optimizing marketing budgets and retaining customers. The "Deal Hunters" customer group – those who only make purchases during large promotions and leave immediately afterward – reduces customer retention rates after Mega Sale events.  

The **Shopee Decii** project was created to address this issue by leveraging **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to analyze user behavior, predict churn trends, and optimize customer retention strategies.

## 2. Project Objectives
- **Short-term (Prediction):** Classify customers likely to return within the next 6 months, supporting short-term strategies.  
- **Long-term (Segmentation):** Cluster customers into three strategic groups:
  - Deal Hunter  
  - Potential Customer  
  - Loyal Customer  

## 3. Repository Structure
The repository includes 4 branches:
- **main**: Contains frontend code demo deployment of the trained model (ReactJS)  
- **frontend**: Frontend code demo deployment of the trained model (ReactJS)  
- **backend**: Backend code demo deployment of the trained model (Spring Boot)  
- **data_model**: Contains datasets and all Jupyter Notebook files used throughout the model building and training process
